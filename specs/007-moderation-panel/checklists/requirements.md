- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 19 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories.
- The screenshot (Screenshot 21, right panel) was consulted to derive the three-section layout, action button labels (Approve/Remove/Warn User and Warn/Suspend/Flag to Admin), Trust Score display, and the Pending Moderation Actions queue with priority levels.
- Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan` or `/speckit-clarify`.
